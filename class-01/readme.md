## What is List in Python?
A list is a data structure in Python that is a mutable, or changeable, ordered sequence of elements. Each element or value that is inside of a list is called an item. Just as strings are defined as characters between quotes, lists are defined by having values between square brackets [ ].

## Difference between List and Array in Python

- List:A list in Python is a collection of items which can contain elements of multiple data types, which may be either numeric, character logical values, etc. It is an ordered collection supporting negative indexing. A list can be created using [] containing data values.
    Example:-

Question | Output
------------ | -------------
sample_list = [1,"Yash",['a','e']]|
print(sample_list)                  [1, 'Yash', ['a', 'e']]
